The issue arises because the **RandomForestClassifier** or the **preprocessing pipeline** in your project might not be generalizing well to all inputs, especially commands similar to those in your dataset but slightly different in structure. This can lead to **misclassifications** like marking malicious commands as benign.

Here’s a structured approach to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

---

## **Step 1: Verify Dataset and Labels**

1. **Check the Dataset**:
   - Ensure that all malicious commands (`label = 1`) are correctly labeled in your dataset (`keystrokes_large.csv`).
   - If the dataset contains duplicates or incorrectly labeled commands, the model might learn inaccurate patterns.

   Example:
   ```bash
   cat data/keystrokes_large.csv | grep "mv /etc/passwd"
   ```
   Verify it’s labeled correctly as `1`.

2. **Balance the Dataset**:
   Ensure an equal number of benign and malicious commands to avoid bias.

---

## **Step 2: Address the ML Model Misclassification**

### Root Causes:
1. **Feature Vector Mismatch**:
   - The `TfidfVectorizer` may not generalize to unseen commands if they contain new terms or structures.
   - The model may not have enough context for `mv /etc/passwd /tmp` if similar variations weren’t adequately represented during training.

2. **Model Complexity**:
   - **RandomForestClassifier** might struggle with highly sparse feature spaces generated by `TfidfVectorizer`.

### Fixes:
1. **Augment the Dataset**:
   - Add more malicious commands with variations:
     - Examples:
       ```plaintext
       "mv /etc/shadow /tmp",1
       "cp /etc/passwd /tmp",1
       "chmod 000 /etc/passwd",1
       ```

2. **Re-train the Model with Augmented Data**:
   Update the dataset with augmented data and re-run the training script.

   ```bash
   python models/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Adjust the Vectorizer**:
   Use **n-grams** in `TfidfVectorizer` to capture sequences of words rather than individual terms:
   ```python
   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))
   ```

4. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
   Use the evaluation script to test the new model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Debugging Misclassifications**

### Modify `malicious_input_engine.py` for Debugging

Add debugging output to `is_malicious_ml` to see how the model processes specific commands.

#### Updated `is_malicious_ml`:
```python
def is_malicious_ml(command, vectorizer, clf):
    """
    Check if the command is malicious using the trained model.
    """
    try:
        print(f"Analyzing Command: {command}")
        
        # Transform the command
        X_test = vectorizer.transform([command])
        prediction = clf.predict(X_test)
        print(f"Prediction: {prediction[0]}")
        
        # Debugging: Print feature importance
        feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
        important_features = sorted(zip(clf.feature_importances_, feature_names), reverse=True)[:10]
        print(f"Top Features: {important_features}")
        
        return prediction[0] == 1
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in malicious analysis: {e}")
        return False
```

---

## **Step 4: Enhance the Classification Pipeline**

### a. Use a More Advanced Classifier
Switch from `RandomForestClassifier` to a more robust model like **`GradientBoostingClassifier`** or **`XGBoost`**, which can handle sparse and complex datasets better.

#### Example Update in `train_model.py`:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Initialize GradientBoostingClassifier
clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
```

---

### b. Use Word Embeddings
Instead of `TfidfVectorizer`, use **pre-trained embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for better generalization.

#### Example: Use `gensim` for Word2Vec:
```bash
pip install gensim
```

Update the feature extraction in `train_model.py`:
```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

def train_word2vec(corpus):
    corpus = [command.split() for command in corpus]
    model = Word2Vec(sentences=corpus, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
    return model

# Train Word2Vec on the dataset
word2vec_model = train_word2vec(X_train)
```

---

## **Step 5: Re-Test with Debugging**

1. **Run the Keystroke Interception**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/keystroke_interception.py
   ```

2. **Type Commands**:
   - Test both **benign** and **malicious** commands, including edge cases like `mv /etc/passwd /tmp`.

3. **Observe Debug Logs**:
   - Check the command's processing, vectorization, and prediction.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Re-train the model with an enhanced dataset and classifier.
   - Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. **Adjust Workflow**:
   - Continue augmenting the dataset with real-world malicious commands.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters (`learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, etc.).

### **Key Differences and Required Changes**

#### **1. Programming Language**
- **Current**: Python (higher-level and library-driven).
- **Paper**: C++ (low-level with direct system API access).
- **Changes**:
  - For low-level features (e.g., USB enforcement or OS locking), use Python bindings to native APIs like **Win32 APIs** or integrate with C++ modules.
  - Retain Python for high-level tasks (e.g., ML model training, GUI interaction).

---

#### **2. Device Detection**
- **Current**: Python `pyusb` or subprocess calls (`lsusb`) in `device_detection.py`.
- **Paper**: RawInput API and Windows-specific `WM_DEVICECHANGE` messages for granular device detection.
- **Changes**:
  - Improve device detection to monitor real-time USB events:
    - For **Windows**: Use `pywin32` to handle device change notifications.
    - For **Linux/macOS**: Continue using `pyudev` or `subprocess` for USB monitoring.
  - Example (Windows):
    ```python
    import win32api
    import win32gui
    import win32con

    def detect_device_changes():
        class DeviceNotification:
            def __init__(self):
                self.hwnd = win32gui.CreateWindow(
                    "STATIC", "USBNotifier", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, None
                )

            def message_loop(self):
                while True:
                    win32gui.PumpMessages()

        notifier = DeviceNotification()
        notifier.message_loop()
    ```

- **Current**: Random Forest model for classification in `malicious_input_engine.py`.
- **Paper**: Modular approach combining **machine learning**, **signature matching**, and **cryptoanalysis**.
- **Changes**:
  - Add modular detection layers:
    - **Signature Matching**:
      - Add a rule-based system to detect known patterns (e.g., rapid repetitive commands or common malicious strings like `rm -rf`).
      - Integrate a JSON or YAML file for dynamic rule management.
    - **Behavior Analysis**:
      - Include context-aware detection (e.g., tracking typing patterns or analyzing sequences of commands).

---

#### **5. Encryption**
- **Current**: Optional encryption (`encryption.py`) using basic AES for logs.
- **Paper**: Homomorphic encryption for secure data analysis.
- **Changes**:
  - Fully integrate homomorphic encryption for real-time command classification:

    - Encrypt intercepted commands before sending them for analysis.
  - Example integration for homomorphic encryption:
    ```python
    from scripts.encryption import encrypt_command

    encrypted_command = encrypt_command(command, context)
    prediction = is_malicious_ml(encrypted_command, vectorizer, clf)
    ```

---

#### **6. Robust Enforcement**
- **Current**: No active enforcement mechanism.
- **Paper**: Dynamic USB disconnection and OS locking.
- **Changes**:
  - Add an **enforcement module**:
    - USB blocking:
      - For **Windows**: Use `pywin32` or system calls to disable devices.
      - For **Linux/macOS**: Use `pyudev` to unmount devices.
    - OS locking:
      - Implement using native APIs (e.g., `LockWorkStation` on Windows).
  - Example USB blocking on Linux:
    ```python
    import os

    def block_usb_device(device_name):
        os.system(f"sudo umount /dev/{device_name}")
    ```

- **Changes**:
  - Profile code using `cProfile` or `timeit` to identify bottlenecks.
  - Optimize:
    - Vectorization (`TfidfVectorizer`).
    - Model inference (switch to lightweight models like `LogisticRegression` if Random Forest is too slow).

---
